Engineers in Australia have achieved a significant milestone by creating reinforced concrete through the innovative use of roasted, used coffee grounds. This breakthrough not only enhances the material's strength but also presents an eco-friendly solution to reduce waste in landfills.

Lead author Dr. Rajeev Roychand, from RMIT University, spearheaded the project. The team devised a method to boost concrete strength by 30% through the conversion of waste coffee grounds into biochar. This transformation occurs through a low-energy process conducted at 350 degrees Celsius in an oxygen-free environment.

Dr. Roychand emphasized the environmental significance of their work, stating, "The disposal of organic waste poses an environmental challenge as it emits large amounts of greenhouse gases including methane and carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change." This development provides a valuable alternative to the disposal of the 75 million kilograms of ground coffee waste generated annually in Australia, a substantial portion of which typically ends up in landfills. Globally, an astonishing 10 billion kilograms of spent coffee is generated each year.

The findings, detailed in the Journal of Cleaner Production, mark a pioneering achievement, proving that waste coffee grounds can significantly enhance concrete.

Dr. Shannon Kilmartin-Lynch, a co-lead author and Vice-Chancellor's Indigenous Postdoctoral Research Fellow at RMIT, highlighted the potential impact on construction industries worldwide. "The concrete industry has the potential to contribute significantly to increasing the recycling of organic waste such as used coffee," Kilmartin-Lynch asserted.

Professor Jie Li, corresponding author and leader of the research team, emphasized the broader environmental implications. The coffee biochar can substitute a portion of the sand traditionally used in concrete production, reducing the reliance on natural sand extraction, a process with notable environmental consequences.

"50 billion tonnes of natural sand are used in construction projects globally every year," noted Professor Li. "There are critical and long-lasting challenges in maintaining a sustainable supply of sand due to the finite nature of resources and the environmental impacts of sand mining."

Dr. Mohammad Saberian, a co-researcher, underlined the urgency for the construction industry to explore alternative raw materials for long-term sustainability.

As the project progresses, the researchers plan to develop practical implementation strategies and initiate field trials. They are enthusiastic about collaborating with various industries to further advance their groundbreaking research.
