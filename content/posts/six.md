The urban landscape is a dynamic tapestry, weaving together the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. However, envisioning how a city should evolve and transform while considering the well-being of its residents can be an intricate puzzle. Addressing this complexity, a team of dedicated cartographers at Ruhr University Bochum have embarked on a remarkable journey into the world of virtual reality (VR) to explore urban scenarios and their real-world impacts.

In a groundbreaking endeavor, these cartographers utilize cutting-edge tools powered by the Unity3 game engine. This powerful engine allows them to bring to life 3D scenarios, enabling individuals to immerse themselves in potential urban changes. This innovative approach represents a leap forward in urban planning, empowering city planners, architects, and stakeholders to scrutinize the consequences of structural modifications before substantial investments are made. The outcomes of this pioneering research have been presented in two recent publications: one in the esteemed KN -- Journal of Cartography and Geographic Information on May 1, 2023, and another in Applied Sciences on May 13, 2023.


Urban transformations through construction initiatives have a profound impact on both permanent residents and transient visitors. Predicting these effects accurately can be a daunting task. To address this challenge, the cartographers, led by Marco Weißmann, employ software initially designed for crafting computer game environments. "We've developed a lab kit of sorts in which you can simulate an environment virtually, complete with traffic," Weißmann explains. This versatile tool allows researchers to create immersive 3D models that unveil the repercussions of proposed structural changes. Questions arise: How does traffic flow within the envisioned urban landscape? Do vehicles and pedestrians seamlessly coexist, or do they collide in chaotic discord?


Furthermore, the physical environment profoundly influences our well-being, albeit sometimes subtly. While individuals may adapt to certain environmental conditions, their subconscious reactions can be more telling. Julian Keil points out, "People who've lived on a noisy street for a long time, for example, might think they don't even hear the noise anymore, but we know that, objectively speaking, residents in such streets experience significantly higher stress levels than others."

To pre-emptively discern these implicit effects of urban planning initiatives, the cartography team devised a method to measure them in advance. By constructing urban environments within virtual reality and having participants immerse themselves in these scenarios, the researchers could gauge stress levels using skin conductivity measurements. The results were illuminating—higher traffic volume unequivocally increased stress levels among the participants.

To bolster these findings, the team is poised to incorporate additional physical measurements, including heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size, to delve deeper into the emotional responses of individuals. This multifaceted approach empowers spatial planners to assess implicit effects systematically and integrate them into the urban planning process effectively.


In addition to their groundbreaking research, the team demonstrated their commitment to sustainability by conducting their experiments in an eco-conscious manner. They harnessed electricity from a mobile solar system mounted on the institute building's roof, underlining their dedication to climate-friendly research practices.

As urban landscapes evolve, these cartographers are pioneering innovative tools that can guide the way forward. By harnessing the power of virtual reality, they offer urban planners and architects an invaluable glimpse into the future, where the well-being of city dwellers remains at the heart of every transformation. This visionary approach stands as a testament to their dedication to creating sustainable and livable cities for generations to come.
