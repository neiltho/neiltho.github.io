In a groundbreaking collaboration, researchers at the University of California San Diego have unveiled a pioneering advancement in environmental science: an "engineered living material" designed to combat water pollution sustainably and effectively. This innovative material, composed of a seaweed-based polymer interwoven with genetically modified bacteria, shows immense promise in the fight against organic pollutants.

Described in a recent paper published in the esteemed journal Nature Communications, this development represents a quantum leap in the field of materials science. Professor Jon Pokorski, a key figure in the project, underscored the uniqueness of this creation, stating, "What's innovative is the pairing of a polymer material with a biological system to create a living material that can function and respond to stimuli in ways that regular synthetic materials cannot."

This extraordinary achievement is the result of a close collaboration between engineers, materials scientists, and biologists at the UC San Diego Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC). The multidisciplinary team, featuring molecular biology professors Susan Golden and James Golden, alongside nanoengineering professor Shaochen Chen, pooled their expertise to bring this vision to life.

The cornerstone of this engineered living material is alginate, a natural polymer derived from seaweed. When hydrated, it forms a gel that serves as the matrix for a specific type of photosynthetic bacteria known as cyanobacteria. This mixture was then fed into a 3D printer, where it underwent various iterations to determine the optimal geometry for preserving the bacteria's vitality. A grid-like structure emerged as the most effective, offering a high surface area to volume ratio which maximized the bacteria's access to vital nutrients, gases, and light.

Beyond its structural excellence, this material exhibited extraordinary capabilities in the realm of decontamination. As a proof-of-concept, the team engineered the cyanobacteria to continuously produce a decontaminating enzyme known as laccase. Studies have shown that laccase possesses the ability to neutralize a wide array of organic pollutants, ranging from bisphenol A (BPA) to pharmaceutical drugs and dyes. Notably, the material showcased its prowess in decontaminating indigo carmine, a prominent blue dye used extensively in the textile industry.

However, the true innovation lies in the material's built-in "self-destruct" mechanism. Through genetic engineering, the cyanobacteria were designed to respond to theophylline, a molecule commonly found in tea and chocolate. In the presence of theophylline, the bacteria activate a protein that leads to their own demise, ensuring they pose no environmental threat after completing their decontamination task.

Professor Pokorski expressed the importance of this self-contained approach, stating, "The living material can act on the pollutant of interest, then a small molecule can be added afterwards to kill the bacteria. This way, we can alleviate any concerns about having genetically modified bacteria lingering in the environment."

Yet, the researchers aspire to refine this mechanism further, with the ultimate goal of having the bacteria self-terminate without the need for additional chemicals. This aspiration represents a promising future direction for this transformative research endeavor.

In sum, this achievement at UC San Diego represents a paradigm shift in environmental science and materials engineering. With an unwavering commitment to harnessing the power of nature, this "engineered living material" offers a beacon of hope in the global quest for sustainable solutions to water pollution. This remarkable feat stands as a testament to the incredible potential that emerges when experts from disparate fields come together to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges. Thanks to the visionary interdisciplinary research group at UC San Diego MRSEC, the possibilities for future innovation in this domain appear boundless.
