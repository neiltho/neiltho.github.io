In a significant leap forward for traffic management and road infrastructure planning, researchers at The Ohio State University have unveiled a groundbreaking method for counting and tracking vehicles on public roads. Utilizing the existing cameras installed on campus buses, this innovative approach promises to enhance traffic systems, reduce congestion, and ultimately make journeys more efficient for travelers.

Published in the journal Sensors, the study showcases the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process of identifying and monitoring vehicles, offering a cost-effective solution that harnesses available resources.

Lead author of the study, Keith Redmill, a research associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State, highlighted the need for comprehensive, high-resolution spatial information about road activities. He emphasized that such data can empower planners to better understand changes in traffic demand, thus improving the overall efficiency of transportation systems.

The uniqueness of this research lies in its transformation of manual vehicle identification into an automated process using AI. Prior studies at Ohio State had relied on human observers to manually identify vehicles in video footage. However, this latest study demonstrates the capabilities of AI in detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time, significantly streamlining the process.

Mark McCord and Rabi Mishalani, co-authors of the study and professors of civil, environmental, and geodetic engineering at Ohio State, explained that their team chose to utilize the campus bus service's traffic cameras because the university's interconnected campus closely resembles a small city. This setting allowed them to access collected videos and employ them for traffic monitoring.

Tom Holman, Ohio State's director of Transportation and Traffic Management, emphasized the collaborative spirit of the university's partnership with the Campus Area Bus Service (CABS). Sharing access to bus cameras for traffic monitoring exemplifies how university operations can support research and learning while generating valuable data for long-term traffic planning, Holman said.

What sets this research apart from similar traffic studies is its utilization of available resources without additional costs. By repurposing bus cameras originally installed for safety and security purposes, this approach offers a cost-effective solution that can be readily integrated into other cities' traffic monitoring systems.

According to Rabi Mishalani, the study aims to fully automate the process of traffic measurement, eliminating the need for manual intervention. He stressed the potential value of a system that can measure traffic as effectively as conventional fixed sensors but at a fraction of the cost.

The heart of this system lies in a state-of-the-art 2D deep learning model known as YOLOv4, which automates object detection and tracking. Beyond vehicle counting, the algorithm can also project real-world bird's-eye-view coordinates of the road network by combining image streams, GNSS measurements, and regional information from 2D maps. This precision even enables the system to detect deviations from a planned route, providing valuable insights into road conditions.

While the full-scale implementation of this system remains a work in progress, the research holds immense promise for the future of intelligent traffic surveillance. With widespread deployment and integration, this approach could pave the way for more effective road planning and operation. Travelers could experience reduced travel times and increased travel choices, ultimately making their journeys from point A to point B smoother and more efficient.

As Rabi Mishalani noted, "Transportation planners, engineers, and operators make vital decisions about the future of our roadways, so when designing transportation systems to work over the next 30 to 50 years, it's imperative that we give them data that allows them to improve the efficiency of the system and the level of service provided to travelers."

Supported by the United States Department of Transportation's Mobility21 University Transportation Center program, this research exemplifies the potential of AI-driven solutions to revolutionize how we manage and optimize our transportation networks. With innovation like this, the road ahead looks promising for commuters and city planners alike.
