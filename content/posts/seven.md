In a groundbreaking effort to address the growing challenge of plastic waste, researchers at UBC Okanagan have unveiled an innovative solution that could transform the way landfills are constructed. By repurposing used plastic bottles, which have long been a significant environmental concern, these scientists have found a way to not only divert them from landfills but also utilize them to stabilize the very structures that house them.

The scale of the plastic waste predicament is staggering, with nearly a hundred million metric tons of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), commonly known as microplastics, produced globally each year. Unfortunately, only a fraction of this immense volume is recycled, making it one of the largest contributors to the global plastic waste crisis.

Doctoral student Alok Chandra, along with his supervisor Dr. Sumi Siddiqua, an esteemed Engineering Professor at UBCO, have pioneered a pioneering technique to integrate PET waste into clay soil stabilizationâ€”a crucial aspect of landfill construction. Chandra emphasizes, "By finding new ways to use these discarded plastics, we can divert them from landfills and use them to stabilize cover materials within landfills."

The innovation lies in the integration of PET waste, which not only enhances the soil's strength but also creates a water-resistant layer, effectively containing pollutants within the landfill. This breakthrough is poised to significantly reduce the environmental impact of landfills, preventing substances like lead from seeping into the surrounding environment.

Dr. Siddiqua underscores the potential of this approach, stating, "Due to its nontoxicity, low biodegradability and accessibility, it shows considerable potential for use in landfill designs. This not only solves the solid waste problem but also increases the economic value of waste and encourages its re-circulation back from already polluted lands and oceans."

While the results of this research are highly promising, Chandra acknowledges that there is still work to be done before PET waste can be seamlessly integrated into landfill soil stabilization management. Nevertheless, this pioneering endeavor represents a significant step towards a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious approach to landfill construction.

The findings of this study have been published in the esteemed journal Waste Management and were made possible through funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants Program. This research not only points to a more sustainable future for landfill construction but also serves as a testament to the power of innovative thinking in solving some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.
