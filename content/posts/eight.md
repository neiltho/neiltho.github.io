Beneath the bustling streets of major global cities lies a subtle yet significant hazardâ€”an underground climate change phenomenon that has been, until now, widely overlooked. A groundbreaking study from Northwestern University has unveiled the intricate connection between underground climate change and the shifting ground beneath urban landscapes. As temperatures rise, the ground undergoes deformations, causing foundations of buildings and the surrounding earth to experience excessive movement and even cracking. This transformative research sheds light on a previously unrecognized threat to the operational performance and longevity of urban structures, suggesting that past building damage may have been influenced by rising temperatures and warning that these issues are likely to persist.

While the consequences of rising temperatures pose a risk to our infrastructure, the researchers also view this as an opportunity for innovative solutions. By harnessing the waste heat emitted underground from subterranean transportation systems, parking facilities, and basement structures, urban planners could potentially mitigate the effects of underground climate change. This approach not only offers a means to address this burgeoning concern but also unlocks an untapped thermal energy resource.

This groundbreaking study, set to be published in Communications Engineering, a Nature Portfolio journal on July 11, marks a pivotal moment in understanding the impact of subsurface heat islands on civil infrastructure. It is the first study to quantify ground deformations caused by this underground climate change phenomenon.

Alessandro Rotta Loria, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, underscores the significance of this underground climate change, stating, "The ground is deforming as a result of temperature variations, and no existing civil structure or infrastructure is designed to withstand these variations."

So, what exactly is underground climate change? In urban areas worldwide, heat continuously emanates from buildings and underground transportation systems, causing the ground to warm at an alarming rate. This phenomenon, known as "underground climate change" or "subsurface heat islands," has been associated with ecological and health issues. However, its impact on civil infrastructure has remained largely unexplored.

The team at Northwestern conducted an extensive study in the heart of Chicago, installing a wireless network of over 150 temperature sensors across the Chicago Loop, both above and below ground. Data from this network revealed that underground temperatures beneath the Loop are often 10 degrees warmer than those beneath a nearby greenspace. These findings provide crucial insights into the magnitude of subsurface temperature variations and their potential effects on urban infrastructure.

To further understand the long-term implications of this phenomenon, Rotta Loria built a 3D computer model simulating ground temperature evolution from 1951 to the present day. The simulations revealed that warmer temperatures can lead to ground swelling or contraction, causing shifts that exceed the tolerances of many building components and foundation systems.

While this subsurface climate change may not result in sudden structural failures, its slow and imperceptible impacts over time can significantly compromise the operational requirements of structures and infrastructures. Rotta Loria notes, "It's very likely that underground climate change has already caused cracks and excessive foundation settlements that we didn't associate with this phenomenon because we weren't aware of it."

Moving forward, Rotta Loria advocates for the integration of geothermal technologies to harness waste heat and provide it to buildings for space heating. Additionally, planners can implement thermal insulation on new and existing structures to minimize the heat entering the ground. The ultimate goal is to minimize wasted heat and ensure that underground structures remain isolated from temperature fluctuations.

As we delve into this new realm of understanding, it becomes clear that the silent threat below our cities demands our attention. By recognizing and addressing underground climate change, we can pave the way for more resilient and sustainable urban environments, safeguarding our cities for generations to come.
